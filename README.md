This is the beginning of something special hopefully. This project was made to serve as a progress tracker and to also build my dream game. 

"My Action RPG" is the culmination of what I would want in an Action RPG. I was inspired by Castlevania, Berserk, Afro Samurai, Warring periods Japan, Dark Souls (art-wise), Ghost of Tsushima, and fighting games.

Main components I have implemented so far:
  Implementing Character Sprites, Generating Asssets etc. (trying to implement some easy diffusion character sprite sheets to replace one's from tutorial
  Implemented a level up system
  Created Chests in game
  Made a camera that follows player
  Implemented a boundary for the game as well as created the landscape
  Downloaded and currently tweeking different character sprites as well as different design choices for background
  
 Components I think would be cool:
  Different animations for combos
  New weapons in game, need to also update spritesheets to reflect characters being given new weapons
  Add in some kind of enemy
  Make attacks "feel heavier" give sound, shake, to attacks
  Create a character sheet, I'm thinking like genshin where you can do health, defense, elements, crit, etc.
  Add in NPCs with dialogue options
  
  Things I want to ask Colby for help with
  Create audio for game, background music as well as enemy music
    Music starts when enemy comes
    Notification sound of opening chest
