This is the beginning of something special hopefully. This project was made to serve as a progress tracker and to also build my dream game. 

"My Action RPG" is the culmination of what I would want in an Action RPG. I was inspired by Castlevania, Berserk, Afro Samurai, Warring periods Japan, Dark Souls (art-wise), Ghost of Tsushima, and fighting games.

To contribute to my repo and play the game, just download this zip or clone, whatever floats your boat. Then download Godot 3.5, (project breaks on 4.0) -> https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/windows/

Once you have Godot open it up, then import ptoject and there is a "project.godot" file you just double click on the executable!

As of 11/8 only at 11 MB! I'll try to add pictures of my progress to this later on, but if you want to see just pull it down.
