This is the beginning of something special hopefully. This project was made to serve as a progress tracker and to also build my dream game. 

"My Action RPG" is the culmination of what I would want in an Action RPG. I was inspired by Castlevania, Berserk, Afro Samurai, Warring periods Japan, Dark Souls (art-wise), Ghost of Tsushima, and fighting games.

Main components I have implemented so far:
  Main Character with Experience Interface
  Created Chests in game (not working)
  Made a camera that follows player
  Implemented a boundary for the game as well as created the landscape
  Houses, inside of houses, inventory, enemies
  
 Components I think would be cool:
  Different animations for combos
  New weapons in game, need to also update spritesheets to reflect characters being given new weapons
  Add in NPCs with dialogue options
  
  Things I want to ask Colby for help with
  Create audio for game, background music as well as enemy music
    Music starts when enemy comes
    Notification sound of opening chest
