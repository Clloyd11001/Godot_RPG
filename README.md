**PRE-ALPHA DEVELOPMENT**

"My Action RPG" is the culmination of what I would want in an Action RPG. I was inspired by Castlevania, Berserk, Afro Samurai, Warring periods Japan, Dark Souls (art-wise, screw the combat lol) and Ghost of Tsushima, so basically typicall weeb stuff.

To contribute to my repo and play the game, just download this zip or clone, whatever floats your boat. Then download Godot 3.5, (project breaks on 4.0) -> https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/windows/

Once you have Godot open it up, then import ptoject and there is a "project.godot" file you just double click on the executable!
